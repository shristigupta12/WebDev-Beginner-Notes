<h2>Lyrics of a song called "Hall of Fame"</h2>
<pre>
    Yeah, you can be the greatest, you can be the best
    You can be the King Kong bangin' on your chest
    You can beat the world, you can beat the war
    You can talk to God, go bangin' on his door
    You can throw your hands up, you can beat the clock (Yeah)
    You can move a mountain, you can break rocks
    Some will call it practice, some will call it luck
    But either way you're going to the history book
    Standin' in the Hall of Fame (Yeah)
    And the world's gonna know your name (Yeah)
    'Cause you burn with the brightest flame (Yeah)
    And the world's gonna know your name (Yeah)
    And you'll be on the walls of the Hall of Fame
    You can go the distance, you can run the mile
    You can walk straight through hell with a smile
    You can be a hero, you can get the gold
    Breakin' all theâ€¦
